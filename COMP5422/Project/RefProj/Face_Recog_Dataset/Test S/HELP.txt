Help for Face Recognition Software:

Steps to be followed while running the application:
1.Start Matlab.
2.Run only the figure file named Face.
3.An interface will be displayed on the screen.
4.To test the testbase and the database click on the respective buttons on the GUI(Graphical User Interface).
5.Click on the Query input button to select the name of the face to be recognized.
:::REMEMBER:::
Do not press profile or detect faces button before giving input image name or else the software won't work and an error would pop out on the command window of MATLAB.
6.Either press the Detect Faces button or the profile button to obtain the recognized face from the database and to obtain the bio-data of the individual respectively.
Thus the face recognition software can be implemented on the windows platform.
