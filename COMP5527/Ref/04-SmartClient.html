<H2>What is a Smart Client anyway?</H2>
<P>And what makes it so smart?</P>
<P>The term Smart Client was coined to highlight the differences between the 
typical "Rich Client" applications of yesteryear and the next generation of 
client applications. To understand these differences, and to understand how they 
are likely to change the face of client-side computing, it is useful to take a 
trip down memory lane...</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Client Applications: Then and Now 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>In the dim and distant past (that is, the mid 1990's) there was a dramatic 
increase in the number of client applications being developed for the Microsoft® 
Windows® platform. This increase occurred in large part due to the availability 
of high-quality developer tools and frameworks (such as Microsoft® Visual 
Basic®, Microsoft Visual Studio®, MFC, and so on) and because of the 
availability of a feature-rich client platform. Ah, developer heaven.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The majority of these applications were standalone and operated on the client 
machine with no regard to the environment in which they operated, both with 
respect to the other machines and services on the network, and with respect to 
the other applications on the user's machine. Very often, integration between 
applications was limited to using the cut-copy-paste features provided by 
Windows to transfer small amounts of data between applications. On the whole, 
though, users were pleased with the increasingly useful functionality that these 
applications now provided.</P>
<P></P>
<P>After a while, two-tier applications started to appear; these allowed 
multiple users to access common data that resided on the network. Shortly 
thereafter, DCOM allowed applications to become more distributed, with logic and 
state no longer tied to the client machine. Both of these developments were 
important and enabled a whole host of new scenarios and better 
functionality.</P>
<P></P>
<P>All of this increased flexibility and functionality, however, came at a 
price. Perhaps the biggest problem with rich client applications was that of 
deployment. As the complexity of the applications and the client platform had 
increased, so had the difficulty associated with deploying the application to 
the client machine in a reliable and secure way. One of the biggest problems was 
that of "DLL Hell," where one application could break another application by 
deploying an incompatible shared component or library.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, the increasingly connected nature of applications brought with 
it many other problems. Connected applications were considerably more complex to 
develop, despite the availability of developer tools and frameworks. And as the 
size and complexity of these distributed applications grew, the tight coupling 
between the client application and the services it consumed became increasingly 
difficult to maintain, which in turn exacerbated the deployment and maintenance 
problems.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So, while rich clients typically provided a great user experience and had 
good developer support, they were still just too difficult to deploy and 
maintain.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Around this time, the Internet came along.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Internet had very little effect on rich client applications. Some 
applications provided the ability to notify the user of available updates, or 
allowed additional content or features to be downloaded and installed, but on 
the whole, the Internet had little influence on how client applications were 
developed, deployed, and maintained.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Internet did provide an alternative to the traditional rich client model, 
however, one which promised to solve all of the problems associated with 
application deployment and maintenance. Thin client browser-based applications 
allowed applications to be deployed and updated centrally, thereby reducing the 
problems (and therefore the cost) associated with deploying and maintaining an 
application. Also, thin client applications allowed companies to expose their 
applications to a large and diverse external audience.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Unfortunately, this brave new world was not without disadvantages.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Thin client applications at that time often represented the best way to 
expose a company's information and services to an external user base. But in 
many cases, internal applications that would have traditionally been implemented 
using a rich client application were also moved to the thin client model. While 
this movement had advantages in reducing deployment complexity, it did so at the 
cost of the user experience.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The usability of the applications was often much reduced and common features 
that the user had grown accustomed to, such as drag-and-drop, undo-redo, context 
sensitive help, and so on, were no longer available. Furthermore, the 
responsiveness of the application was diminished, especially for business 
applications, such as those in customer call centers, which demanded heavy data 
entry and navigation across multiple screens.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And of course, the browser was entirely dependent on having a network 
connection at all times. This meant that mobile workers had no access to the 
applications at all, requiring them to re-enter data when they returned to the 
office. And even when a connection was available, low bandwidth or high latency 
connections caused performance problems and a reduction in user efficiency.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Developers, too, suffered in the early days of thin clients. Tool support was 
lacking, and developers had to move from the cozy world of component-based 
development, with type safety and object-oriented design principles, to the 
harsh and unforgiving world of script and HTML. Only now can Web developers 
claim to have anything approaching the same level of support as client 
developers enjoyed 4 or 5 years ago. Even now, drag-and-drop, undo-redo, context 
sensitive help, and other common client-side features are still extremely 
challenging.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Despite these drawbacks, the deployment and management problems associated 
with rich clients were so big that the tradeoff seemed worth it. As a result, 
the thin client browser-based application model has dominated in recent 
years.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Client Applications: The Next Generation 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>Today we live in an information-based economy. In order to thrive in this 
hyper-competitive market, users must access and borrow information from many 
sources, including customers, partners, and suppliers. And users are now 
demanding more from their applications: they want to be empowered to act, plan, 
analyze, visualize, and explore the data, not just to read it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Such concerns are not limited to a company's internal workforce. Leading 
companies are increasingly becoming aware that they have to build a digital 
relationship with their customers and partners, allowing them to provide faster 
and more accurate responses to customer requests and giving them easy access to 
purchasing, inventory, and shipping-status information. These users also need to 
be able to work with the data within their own applications.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Without question, the complexity of applications is increasing, and with it 
the expectations of the user. The thin client model is no longer able to provide 
the required levels of functionality, performance, flexibility, and integration. 
Users are now demanding fast and responsive applications to perform their daily 
work in a flexible and efficient manner. Add this to the explosion of devices 
and the increasing mobility of the workforce and it is clear that a new category 

of client application is required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So, the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the rich client model. But 
what about application deployment and update? The TCO of an application is still 
as important as it ever was, probably more so. Do you sacrifice manageability 
for usability, or vice versa?</P>
<P></P>
<P><SPAN>Happily, you don't need to sacrifice either. Key capabilities now exist 
which mean that we can take full advantage of the rich client model, providing 
the user with an excellent user experience, while at the same time reaping the 
benefits of centralized deployment and update. In short, this new generation of 
client applications, the so-called "smart" clients, provides the best of both 
worlds and adds the intelligence to manage data and connectivity to produce an 
extremely compelling user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>W<SPAN>hile smart clients provide the benefits of a rich client 
model with thin client manageability, they also provide much more flexibility 
than the traditional rich client applications. For example, smart clients need 
not be designed as monolithic desktop applications. Smart client solutions can 
be developed that are composed of functionality from more than one client 
application, with each application collaborating with the others to provide just 
the right functionality to the user. Such "composite" applications integrate 
client-side software resources into a coherent solution, or extend the 
functionality of an existing application to provide smart client features.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, the client platform has moved on in the past few years and now 
includes many different types of client devices, not just desktop PCs. Such 
devices include PDA's, SmartPhones, Tablet PCs, Laptops, set-top boxes, 
automotive devices, retail terminals, and so on. Smart client applications can 
be built to take maximum advantage of the features provided by the host device 
and tuned to provide the best user experience for the typical users of these 
devices.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Smart Client Check List 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>Because of the high degree of flexibility and somewhat ambiguous nature of 
smart client applications, it is often useful to talk about the key 
characteristics of a smart client. These characteristics serve as a guide to the 
features typically provided by smart clients over and above those provided by 
traditional rich client applications. If a client application displays these 
characteristics, then it can be said to be smart:</P>
<P></P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><B>Utilizes Local Resources</B><BR>A smart client application always has 
  code artifacts on the client that enable local resources to be utilized. What 
  do we mean by local resources? We mean everything from hardware to software 
  resources. A smart client may take advantage of the local CPU or GPU, local 
  memory or disk, or any local devices connected to the client, such as a 
  telephone, bar-code/RFID reader, and so on. But it may also take advantage of 
  local software, such as Microsoft Office applications, or any installed 
  line-of-business (LOB) applications that interact with it.<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>Connected</B><BR>Smart client applications are never standalone and 

  always form part of a larger distributed solution. This could mean that the 
  application interacts with a number of Web services that provide access to 
  data or an LOB application. Very often, the application has access to specific 
  services that help maintain the application and provide deployment and update 
  services.<BR><BR>
  <LI><B>Offline Capable<BR></B>Because they are running on the local machine, 
  one of the key benefits that smart client applications offer is that they can 
  be made to work even when the user is not connected. For applications running 
  in occasional or intermittent connectivity situations, such as those used by 
  traveling workers or even those running on laptops, tablets, PDA's, and so on, 
  where connectivity cannot be guaranteed at all times, being able to work while 
  disconnected is essential. Even when the client is connected, the smart client 
  application can improve performance and usability by caching data and managing 
  the connection in an intelligent way.<BR><BR><B>
  <P></P></B>
  <LI><B>Intelligent Install and Update<BR></B>Smart client applications manage 
  their deployment and update in a much<B> </B>more intelligent way than 
  traditional rich client applications. The .NET framework enables application 
  artifacts to be deployed using a variety of techniques, including simple file 
  copy or download over HTTP. Applications can be updated while running and can 
  be deployed on demand by clicking on a URL. The Microsoft® .NET Framework 
  provides a powerful security mechanism that guarantees the integrity of the 
  application and its related assemblies. Assemblies can be given limited 
  permissions in order to restrict their functionality in semi-trusted 
  scenarios.<B><BR><BR>
  <P></P></B>
  <LI><B>Client Device Flexibility<BR></B>The .NET Framework together with the 
  .NET Compact Framework provides a common platform upon which smart client 
  applications can be built. Often, there will be multiple versions of the smart 
  client application, each targeting a specific device type and taking advantage 
  of the devices unique features and providing functionality appropriate to its 
  usage.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P><B>Smart Clients and the .NET Framework 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>So how does the .NET Framework enable all of these smart client benefits?</P>
<P></P>
<P>The .NET Framework provides a number of fundamental capabilities, which means 
that we no longer have to face the difficult usability versus manageability 
tradeoff. Let's look at some of the more important features...</P>
<P></P>
<P>The .NET Framework has very effectively solved the problem of version 
conflicts between assemblies shared by more than one application. A .NET 
application or assembly has a strong coupling to the assemblies and components 
they depend on. Assemblies are annotated with meta-data, which specifies both 
their exact version and the versions of all dependent assemblies. Multiple 
versions of the same assembly can be installed side-by-side so that all 
applications can be run with the exact same version of the assembly that they 
were built and tested against.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This assembly binding mechanism also provides important security safeguards. 
Assemblies can be cryptographically signed to prevent malicious code being run 
inadvertently, either through tampering or through luring attacks. In addition, 
.NET Code Access Security (CAS) allows assemblies to be granted specific 
permissions so that they can be used in semi-trusted scenarios. The .NET runtime 
ensures that assemblies can only carry out operations for which they have been 
granted permissions. The .NET Framework defines a flexible evidence based 
infrastructure for determining which permissions to grant an application or 
assembly.</P>
<P></P>
<P>These features effectively address application stability and predictability, 
but what about deployment? Assemblies do not need to be registered on the local 
machine so they can simply be copied to the machine before they are run. This 
greatly simplifies the deployment of the application. Alternatively, assemblies 
can be downloaded from a central server, either at install or at run time.</P>
<P></P>
<P>.NET also provides a deployment feature called No-Touch Deployment, which 
allows applications to be run on a URL. When the user clicks on the URL, the 
runtime automatically downloads the application, and all related assemblies, to 
a special download cache. This mechanism also checks for version updates so that 
the user never has to worry about whether they are running the latest version of 
the application or not.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Applications deployed in this way are only granted a very limited amount of 
permissions by default and are unable to access the local hard disk or access 
any network services, apart from the service from where they were downloaded. 
Additional permissions can be granted at the user, machine, or enterprise level 
if required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Of course, the .NET Framework provides quite a few other features that affect 
how smart client applications can be designed and built. Of particular important 
are the Microsoft® .NET Windows Forms classes. These classes provide very rich 
user interface controls and give developers in all languages a common UI 
framework to work against, making development and testing much easier. The .NET 
Framework also provides many facilities for connecting to network services, such 
as SOAP-based Web services, and provides comprehensive XML support.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Smart Client Architecture 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>As .NET provides a number of key features that make the development of smart 
client applications easier, what are the architectural implications of all of 
these new features? It turns out that .NET goes beyond solving the problems that 
plagued rich clients and enables a whole host of new possibilities. The client 
platform now includes many different types of client device, and .NET supports 
them through the full and compact frameworks, but that's just the start.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The flexible binding, deployment, and security models provided by .NET allow 
smart client applications to be designed in much more interesting ways than 
traditional rich clients. For example, .NET provides a lot of flexibility in how 
the application can be "hosted": applications can be run as a traditional 
desktop application, or can be hosted within Microsoft® Office or Microsoft® 
Internet Explorer. Many combinations are possible. For instance, a Windows Forms 
application can host Internet Explorer or Office components and any host can 
subsume any other.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Application logic that is volatile, for example business rules governing 
volume order discounts, can be factored into assemblies that are downloaded on 
demand over HTTP, obviating the need to frequently "update" the client 
application in the traditional sense. Additional (or infrequently used) 
application features can adopt the same model so that initial application size 
is kept to a minimum with additional features installed on an as-needed 
basis.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Another popular model is the Composite Application model, where many 
applications combine to form a coherent solution. Such solutions can be formed 
by coupling together desktop applications, or by providing a generic "shell" 
application that houses multiple lightweight applications combining to form the 
solution.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The latter model has proven to be extremely useful in situations where the 
user has to deal with many applications to do their work. For example, customer 
service agents in call centers typically have to deal with many LOB 
applications, including desktop, browser-based, and terminal-based applications. 
All such LOB applications can be hosted within a generic Windows Forms 
application that provides integration between them, greatly simplifying the 
user's job and, most importantly, reducing the time spent on a particular 
call.</P>
<P></P>
<P>By providing a generic shell to host these LOB applications, common 
infrastructure features, such as security, deployment, window management, 
application integration, auditing, and so on, can be developed, tested, and 
re-used across different solutions, leaving the developers of the LOB 
applications to focus on business functionality.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Perhaps the most compelling example of a composite smart client application 
is Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office applications can be extended using 
SmartTags, SmartDocuments, or with Microsoft® Visual Studio® Tools for Office 
enabling powerful smart client solutions to be built.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Office smart client solutions can become an integral part of an 
organization's information infrastructure, accessing corporate data and services 
and providing a powerful and familiar working environment. Of course, Web 
services provide a natural way for companies to expose data and services, and 
smart client applications are the ultimate consumers of these Web services. And 
since Microsoft Office also provides XML support, data can easily be shared 
between both client and server and between the user's desktop applications.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Office smart client applications are capable of integrating data and services 
provided by multiple line-of-business (LOB) applications, each accessed through 
separate Web services. Such smart client applications can provide valuable 
Business Intelligence functionality, providing the user with access to critical 
business data in powerful desktop applications, such as Microsoft® Excel, where 
they can visualize, pivot, and analyze the data as much as required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And finally, the advent of service-oriented architectures (SOA) means that 
there are huge opportunities for client applications to take advantage of the 
many and varied services available to them. All such services are provided in an 
industry standard way, which provides huge benefits in terms of 
interoperability, developer tool support, and the ease with which new features 
can be built into the smart client application.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Next Up: Whidbey and Longhorn 
<P></P></B>
<P></P>
<P>The above discussion focuses on the benefits that .NET currently brings to 
the area of smart clients. What about the future? The next release of the 
Microsoft .NET Framework, code-named "Whidbey," will bring a whole set of new 
features that build on the .NET Framework and make smart clients even more 
compelling: richer and more flexible user interface components, easier thread 
management, better tools, and a new deployment feature called click-once, which 
builds on the no-touch deployment mechanism described above.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Microsoft Windows, code-named "Longhorn," will take smart clients to a whole 
new level, with features like the presentation subsystem in Longhorn (code-named 
"Avalon") providing next generation meta-data driven user interfaces, and the 
storage subsystem in Longhorn (code-named "WinFS") providing huge integration 
opportunities between applications. Check out the Longhorn smart client demo for 
commercial real estate at <A

href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/productinfo/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/productinfo/default.aspx</A> 
for a glimpse of the Longhorn smart client vision.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Many analysts have been predicting for a while now that the pendulum has 
swung back towards rich clients and away from browser-based applications. With 
.NET, and especially with Whidbey and Longhorn, it looks like the time of the 
smart client is well and truly upon us.</P>

<DIV class=commentsbody>&lt;David&gt; <BR>Even now, drag-and-drop, undo-redo, 
context sensitive help, and other common client-side features are still 
extremely challenging <BR>&lt;/David&gt; <BR>IE support all these features and 
beyond...(databinding/XML datasources/AOP=attached behaviors/expando properties 
exists in IE for ages) <BR>I'm more close to admit that web client is more 
feature rich(=flexible,powerful etc.) than windows client at present 
time(remember SVG/SMIL or gradients(filters) coming from?),it just another kind. 
<BR>Seems Microsoft agreed with me because it expand her browser BOM to support 
.NET (Longhorn XAML=custom/extended HTML+.NET capabilities) <BR>So smart client 
is simple hosted application-office or IE dosen't matter IMHO,more powerful host 
environment-more powerful application-that's all ;-) </DIV>

<DIV class=commentsbody>Christoph, since you haven't got an answer to you 
question, this is what I think (and I don't claim to be an expert here). I think 
that a smart client is alright if its getting its data through remoting instead 
of web services, what matters (data-wise) I suggest is that it is able to adapt 
to online and offline scenarios (by caching operations) and allow the users to 
work seamlessly 100% of the time. </DIV>

<DIV class=commentsbody>I am new to smart client and just attended David Hill's 
session. I am trying to understand the server side of the smart client. Why does 
it have to be a web server? Why does the client access web services? In other 
words, why can the client be accessing data via normal object instanciation on a 
normal WIN 2003 server, possibly running SQL server? I don't get the advantages 
of the web services? Thank you. </DIV>

<DIV class=commentsbody>Hi! <BR><BR>i'v a little query... is there a way to run 
smart client without a .net framework ... i mean if .net CLR not installed on a 
client machine ..is there a way that smart client automatically detects it and 
downloaad CLR automatically.. this is very crucial for my app.. as my 
requirements are perfectly matched by SmartCLient but my client dont wana 
dowload anythng... so i'm considering to move towards ActiveX. <BR><BR>ur quick

<DIV class=commentsbody>Maintaining data consistency on the client can be a 
problem if you need to account for reliability situations - such as power 
failures, application crashes etc. In these cases it is best to employ a local 
database and write to it using a local transaction. In this way, the data 
remains consistent even in the case of failure. You can use SQL Server, MSDE, 
SQL CE on the client for this. Local consistency is not usually such a problem - 
maintaining consistency of data between the client and server is more 
challenging. <BR><BR>With regard to the time taken to synchronize data, the key 
is to only synchronize data that has changed. This applies to data going to the 
client (for example, cached data) and data going to the server (data that the 
client has changed). There is rarely any need to send all of the data either 
way. And of course, the time taken to synchronize depends on the communication 
mechanism and network connection quality as well as the amount of data. 
<BR><BR>If you need to enable offline use, and expect that data synchronization 
will take a long time, say because of the volume of data or the speed of the 
connection, then the data should be synchronized in the background so that the 
user can carry on working. <BR></DIV>
